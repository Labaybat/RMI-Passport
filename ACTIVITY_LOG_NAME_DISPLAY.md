# Activity Log Name Display Implementation

## Summary of Changes

We've implemented the following changes to ensure staff and admin names are displayed correctly in the Activity Log instead of email addresses:

### 1. Name Fetching and Display
- Modified `logActivityEvent` function to fetch full names from the profiles table
- Added `formatUserName` helper function to consistently format names throughout the component
- Updated the user interface to prioritize full names over email addresses

### 2. Profile Data Integration
- Enhanced data fetching to join activity log entries with user profile data
- Created name maps to efficiently look up user information
- Made sure that existing data works with the new name display format

### 3. Role Determination Improvements
- Fixed role determination to use the profiles table instead of just the is_admin flag
- Updated the user interface to correctly show "Staff" or "Admin" badges based on actual user roles
- Ensured that users like iakwe@thehandicraftshop.com display correctly as "Staff" instead of "Admin"

### 4. Testing Tools
- Created test scripts to verify name display functionality:
  - `test-name-display.js`: Creates test entries with proper user names
  - `check-user-in-log.js`: Checks specific users in the activity log to verify their name and role display

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ActivityLogComponents.tsx`
  - Updated interface to use user_role field
  - Enhanced data transformation to fetch and use full names
  - Improved user interface components to display proper names and roles
  - Added helper functions for name formatting

## How to Test
1. Run the application and navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Open the Activity Log tab
3. Check that staff users (particularly iakwe@thehandicraftshop.com) show as "Staff" and not "Admin"
4. Verify that user full names are displayed instead of email addresses
5. Create new activity log entries and confirm they show the user's name correctly
6. Filter by user type to ensure the correct users appear under each role category

## Next Steps
- Monitor the activity log during normal usage to ensure names continue to display correctly
- Consider adding profile pictures if desired in the future
- Update the admin dashboard to ensure consistent name display across all components
