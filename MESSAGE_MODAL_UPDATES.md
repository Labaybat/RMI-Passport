# Message Modal Improvements

## Message Alignment

We've updated the message alignment pattern based on your specific requirements:

1. For admin/staff users:
   - ALL admin/staff messages appear on the RIGHT side (regardless of who sent them)
   - Messages from regular users appear on the LEFT side

2. For regular users:
   - Their own messages appear on the RIGHT side
   - All admin/staff messages appear on the LEFT side

## Staff Role Recognition Fix

The message alignment system now properly recognizes both admin and staff roles as administrative users, ensuring that:
- Staff users see the same message alignment as admin users (all admin/staff messages on the right)
- Staff and admin users share read status through the same database columns (read_by_admin)
- When one admin/staff reads messages, they're marked as read for all admin/staff users

## Message Notification Improvement

We've also updated how message notifications work between admin and staff users:

1. **Shared Read Status**: When any admin or staff member opens a message modal and views messages from a particular application, those messages are marked as read for ALL admin and staff users.

2. **Benefits**:
   - Eliminates duplicate notification badges across different admin/staff accounts
   - When one staff member responds to a user message, other staff members won't see it as unread
   - Prevents multiple staff members from responding to the same message unnecessarily

3. **Implementation**:
   - When an admin or staff user opens the message modal, all messages from users are marked with `read_by_admin = true`
   - This read status is shared across all admin and staff accounts

## Database Schema

The messages table already has the appropriate structure to support shared read status between admin and staff users:

```sql
read_by_user boolean null default false,
read_by_admin boolean null default false,
user_read_at timestamp with time zone null,
admin_read_at timestamp with time zone null,
```

Both admin and staff users use the `read_by_admin` column to track their read status.

## Testing

A test script has been created (`test-message-alignment-updated.js`) that demonstrates how the message alignment works correctly for admin and staff users.
