# Activity Log Feature - Fixes Applied

## Issue: Multiple exports of `logActivityEvent`

### Problem
The activity log feature had multiple exports of the `logActivityEvent` function, which caused a build error with the message:
```
ERROR: Multiple exports with the same name "logActivityEvent"
```

### Solution
We fixed this by:
1. Keeping the named export of `logActivityEvent` at the top level of the `ActivityLogComponents.tsx` file
2. Removing the duplicate export of `logActivityEvent` from the list of named exports at the bottom of the file
3. Updating the import in `AdminPage.tsx` to correctly reference the function

### Changes Made
1. In `ActivityLogComponents.tsx`:
   - Removed `logActivityEvent` from the list of named exports at the bottom of the file
   - Kept the standalone named export at the top level

2. In `AdminPage.tsx`:
   - Updated the import statement to use the correctly exported function

3. In `admin-logging.ts`:
   - Fixed the import path for the Supabase client to correctly point to `./supabase/client`

## Database Setup
The activity log database table has been successfully created with appropriate row-level security policies:
- Admin users can view all activity logs
- Users can only insert their own activities
- Indexes have been created for better query performance

## Added Activity Logging to Components

### AdminPage.tsx
- Added logging when admins view applications
- Added logging when admins update application status
- Added logging when admins view user profiles
- Added logging when admins update user profiles
- Added logging when admins delete users

### AdminComments.tsx
- Added logging when comments are added to applications
- Added logging when comments are deleted from applications

### MessageModal.tsx
- Added logging when admins view messages for an application
- Added logging when admins send messages to applicants
- Added logging when admins read messages from applicants

## Testing
- The activity log feature can now record administrative actions
- The UI displays all logged activities correctly
- Filtering and search functionalities are working properly

## Usage
Remember to call `logActivityEvent` whenever significant administrative actions occur to maintain a complete audit trail. Example:

```typescript
import { logActivityEvent } from '../components/ActivityLogComponents';

// Log when a user is deleted
await logActivityEvent(
  "Deleted User",  // Action description
  userId,         // Record ID
  {               // Additional details
    userName: userFullName,
    email: userEmail,
    role: userRole
  }
);
```
