# Mobile Device Login/Logout Activity Logging Fix

## Issue Description
Login and logout activities from mobile devices (especially iPad) weren't being properly recorded in the activity log, while other activities from the same mobile devices were successfully recorded.

## Root Cause
The user agent detection in the `admin-logging.ts` file was not properly identifying modern iPads and other mobile devices. The `extractOSInfo()` function was only checking for specific strings like "iPad" in the user agent, but modern iPads with iPadOS often identify themselves differently.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Mobile Device Detection 

1. **Improved iOS Detection**
   - Updated the `extractOSInfo()` function to recognize iOS devices with a broader range of user agents
   - Added detection for modern iPads that may not explicitly include "iPad" in their user agent
   - Added logic to recognize iPadOS devices that identify more like Mac devices but have mobile characteristics

2. **Enhanced Browser Detection**
   - Improved the `extractBrowserInfo()` function to better identify mobile browsers
   - Added specific detection for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on iOS devices

### Verification
A test script (`test-mobile-device-detection.js`) has been created to verify that the enhanced device detection works correctly with various user agents, including:
- Traditional iPads
- Modern iPads with iPadOS
- iPhones
- Chrome on iOS
- Android devices
- Desktop browsers

To run the test:
1. Run the `verify-mobile-detection.bat` script
2. Check the console output for results

## Technical Details

### Changes to extractOSInfo()
Added detection for modern iOS devices that might not explicitly identify themselves as iPad:
```javascript
else if (
  userAgent.includes("iPhone") || 
  userAgent.includes("iPad") || 
  userAgent.includes("iPod") ||
  // Modern iPads with iPadOS may not include "iPad" in user agent
  (userAgent.includes("AppleWebKit") && 
   userAgent.includes("Mobile") && 
   userAgent.includes("Safari") &&
   !userAgent.includes("Android"))
) {
  return "iOS";
}
```

### Changes to extractBrowserInfo()
Added detection for various browsers on iOS:
```javascript
else if (userAgent.includes("CriOS")) {
  // Chrome on iOS
  return "Chrome (iOS)";
} else if (userAgent.includes("FxiOS")) {
  // Firefox on iOS
  return "Firefox (iOS)";
} else if (userAgent.includes("EdgiOS")) {
  // Edge on iOS
  return "Edge (iOS)";  
}
```

## Testing
The changes have been tested with a comprehensive set of user agents to ensure proper detection of various mobile devices and browsers, especially focusing on iPads that were previously not being correctly identified.
